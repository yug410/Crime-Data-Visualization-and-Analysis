# Crime Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of crime data across various states in the USA. It visualizes different crime categories, explores temporal trends, and predicts crime rates based on historical data. The project uses Python and various data visualization tools to present meaningful insights that can help in decision-making for crime prevention.

## Features
**Crime Data by State**: Visualization of crime types across different states.
**Temporal Crime Trends**: A time-series analysis to identify crime frequency over the years.
**Predictive Analysis**: Probability of crime rate prediction based on state data.
**Interactive Visualizations**: Various plots for intuitive analysis, including pie charts, bar graphs, and geographic maps.

## Technologies Used
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Plotly for interactive charts
Geospatial libraries for mapping (e.g., Folium, GeoPandas)
Machine Learning libraries for predictive analysis (e.g., Scikit-learn)
